The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries and tax benefits from final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act regulations in fiscal year 2021, offset in part by an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties.In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and for the six months ended December 31, 2021, the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties.Uncertain Tax PositionsAs of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $16.3billion and $15.9billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit for tax years2004to2006in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years2007to2009in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years2010to2013in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years2004to2013and made a payment of $1.7billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years2004to2017.As of December 31, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.\u00a0Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years1996to2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.",
