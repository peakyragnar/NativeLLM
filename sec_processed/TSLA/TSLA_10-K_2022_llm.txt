@TABLE_CONTENT: ITEM 8.		FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

@TABLE_CONTENT: (1)There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be described below.Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsDuring the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.72
 As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.Credit AgreementIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15% per annum.73
 Automotive Asset-backed NotesFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Solar Asset and Loan-backed NotesOur subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a carrying value of $69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $819 million in aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and recorded an extinguishment of debt charge of $24 million related to the early repayments in Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.Cash Equity Debt In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. These facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.Pledged AssetsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $2.02 billion and $5.25 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property and equipment and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.Schedule of Principal Maturities of DebtThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

@SECTION: ITEM_1A_RISK_FACTORS
@SECTION_TITLE: Risk Factors

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have, at times, limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production. In addition, labor shortages resulting from the pandemic, including worker absenteeism, has led to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers, as well as increased labor costs and supplier delays. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges. Additionally, infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions, which may impact operations. For example, in 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in Shanghai resulted in the temporary shutdown of Gigafactory Shanghai, as well as parts of our supply chain, and impacted our ability to deliver cars.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Lastly, rising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs.

The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

@SECTION: ITEM_2_PROPERTIES
@SECTION_TITLE: Properties

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We are headquartered in Austin, Texas. Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia utilized for manufacturing and assembly, warehousing, engineering, retail and service locations, Supercharger sites and administrative and sales offices. Our facilities are used to support both of our reporting segments, and are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business. We primarily lease such facilities with the exception of some manufacturing facilities. The following table sets forth the location of our primary owned and leased manufacturing facilities.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: * We own the building and the land use rights with an initial term of 50 years. The land use rights are treated as operating lease right-of-use assets.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: In addition, each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed $1 million. We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: The German Umweltbundesamt issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its non-compliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and take-back obligations with respect to end-of-life battery products required thereunder. In response to Tesla’s objection, the German Umweltbundesamt issued Tesla a revised fine notice dated April 29, 2021 in which it reduced the original fine amount to 1.45 million euro. This is primarily relating to administrative requirements, but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs, and filed a new objection in June 2021. A hearing took place on November 24, 2022, and the parties reached a settlement which resulted in a further reduction of the fine to 600,000 euro. Both parties have waived their right to appeal.

@TABLE_CONTENT: ITEM 8.		FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

@TABLE_CONTENT: (1)There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be described below.Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsDuring the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.72
 As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.Credit AgreementIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15% per annum.73
 Automotive Asset-backed NotesFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Solar Asset and Loan-backed NotesOur subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable.

We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth.

@TABLE_CONTENT: ITEM 7A.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

@TABLE_CONTENT: ITEM 8.		FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

@TABLE_CONTENT: (1)There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be described below.Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsDuring the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.72
 As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.Credit AgreementIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15% per annum.73
 Automotive Asset-backed NotesFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Solar Asset and Loan-backed NotesOur subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a carrying value of $69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $819 million in aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and recorded an extinguishment of debt charge of $24 million related to the early repayments in Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.Cash Equity Debt In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. These facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.Pledged AssetsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $2.02 billion and $5.25 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property and equipment and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.Schedule of Principal Maturities of DebtThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

@SECTION: ITEM_7A_MARKET_RISK
@SECTION_TITLE: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan, euro, pound sterling and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations). In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $473 million at December 31, 2022 and $277 million at December 31, 2021, assuming no foreign currency hedging.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

@TABLE_CONTENT: (1)There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be described below.Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsDuring the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant TransactionsIn May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.72
 As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is now convertible into 48.4140 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants had the option to purchase 89.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their par amount, and 2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of 2.4 million shares of our common stock during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $186 million.Credit AgreementIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.15% per annum.73
 Automotive Asset-backed NotesFrom time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. Solar Asset and Loan-backed NotesOur subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a carrying value of $69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $819 million in aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and recorded an extinguishment of debt charge of $24 million related to the early repayments in Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.Cash Equity Debt In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. These facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.Pledged AssetsAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $2.02 billion and $5.25 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property and equipment and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.Schedule of Principal Maturities of DebtThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

@SECTION: ITEM_9A_CONTROLS
@SECTION_TITLE: Controls and Procedures

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

@NARRATIVE_TEXT: Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Example hierarchical data format for extraction:

```json
{
  "line_items": {
    "Product_Revenue": {
      "value": 72480,
      "level": 1,
      "parent": "Total_Revenue"
    },
    "Service_Revenue": {
      "value": 16320,
      "level": 1,
      "parent": "Total_Revenue"
    },
    "Automotive_Revenue": {
      "value": 52300,
      "level": 2,
      "parent": "Product_Revenue"
    },
    "Energy_Revenue": {
      "value": 20180,
      "level": 2,
      "parent": "Product_Revenue"
    }
  },
  "totals": {
    "Total_Revenue": {
      "value": 88800,
      "level": 0,
      "components": ["Product_Revenue", "Service_Revenue"],
      "contexts": {
        "c-1": 88800,           // Using short code
        "FY2023": 88800,        // Using semantic code
        "Consolidated_2023": 88800  // Using segment information
      }
    },
    "Product_Revenue": {
      "value": 72480,
      "level": 1,
      "components": ["Automotive_Revenue", "Energy_Revenue"]
    }
  },
  "verify": {
    "equations": [
      "Total_Revenue = Product_Revenue + Service_Revenue",
      "Product_Revenue = Automotive_Revenue + Energy_Revenue"
    ],
    "verified": true
  },
  "metadata": {
    "statement_type": "Income_Statement",
    "period": "FY2023",
    "hierarchical": true
  }
}
```

Note: This hierarchical structure makes parent-child relationships explicit, enabling accurate calculation and validation of totals. The hierarchy levels indicate:
- Level 0: Main totals (like Total Revenue)
- Level 1: Major categories (like Product Revenue)
- Level 2: Subcategories (like Automotive Revenue)

You can use either the numeric short codes (c-1, c-2) or the semantic codes (FY2023, BS_2023_12_31) to access context values. The semantic codes are more descriptive and self-explanatory.
