# Comprehensive Fiscal Period Data Integrity Solution

## Problem

Incorrect fiscal period mapping in the system led to data integrity issues, especially for companies with non-standard fiscal calendars like NVIDIA. The specific issues included:

1. Multiple competing methods for fiscal period determination created inconsistency
2. NVDA's quarter mapping was incorrect (e.g., May showing as Q2 instead of Q1)
3. Missing validation for period_end_date throughout the pipeline
4. Inadequate audit trail for fiscal determinations

## Solution

We implemented a complete data integrity system with the following components:

### 1. Data Integrity at Origin

- Added robust period_end_date validation in the downloader where data first enters the system
- Created a standardized date normalization function to handle various date formats
- Added comprehensive error handling and metadata tracking at extraction time

### 2. Atomic Transaction Pattern with Data Contract

- Created a `FiscalPeriodInfo` dataclass with strict validation
- Enforced validation for all required fields at creation time
- Implemented custom error handling via `FiscalDataError` exceptions

### 3. Single Source of Truth

- Designated `company_fiscal.py` as the only source for fiscal period determination
- Removed all alternate methods and custom logic from other files
- Implemented comprehensive registry with explicit period_end_date mappings for all companies

### 4. Data Integrity Logging

- Added detailed logging with full audit trail
- Created a metadata structure for tracking all fiscal period determinations
- Included validation timestamps, source information, and processing details

### 5. Verification System

- Implemented a test suite that verifies fiscal period mapping for all companies
- Tests all major companies (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL) across multiple fiscal years
- Added validation tests for the data contract 

### 6. Circuit Breaker Pattern

- Added strict validation with proper error handling
- Implemented a fail-fast approach for invalid data
- Created a consistent fallback mechanism for system errors only

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: All fiscal periods are now correctly determined using a single, reliable method
2. **Transparency**: Complete audit trail for every fiscal determination
3. **Scalability**: The system handles companies with different fiscal calendars consistently
4. **Reliability**: Extensive validation prevents bad data from propagating
5. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth simplifies future updates

## Specific NVDA Fix

The system now correctly maps NVDA's fiscal periods:
- Q1: April (annual + 3 months)
- Q2: July (annual + 6 months) 
- Q3: October (annual + 9 months)
- Annual: January

This ensures all NVDA filings have the correct fiscal periods in Firestore, GCS paths, and document names.
