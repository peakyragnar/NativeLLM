# Microsoft Fiscal Period Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix Microsoft's fiscal period issues and how to run the fix.

## The Problem

Microsoft has a non-calendar fiscal year that ends in June. The correct fiscal periods are:
- Q1: Jul-Sep
- Q2: Oct-Dec
- Q3: Jan-Mar
- Annual (never Q4): Apr-Jun

The system was incorrectly creating "Q4" entries for Microsoft filings instead of using "annual" for the Apr-Jun period.

## The Solution

We've implemented a simple three-step approach:

1. **Fixed the fiscal period logic** in `src/edgar/company_fiscal.py`:
   - For Microsoft's Apr-Jun period, we now correctly assign "annual" to both 10-K and 10-Q filings
   - Updated comments to clearly document that Microsoft should NEVER have a Q4

2. **Created a script to delete incorrect entries** (`fix_msft_fiscal_periods.py`):
   - Identifies all Microsoft entries in Firestore with "Q4" fiscal period
   - Deletes these entries from Firestore
   - Deletes the corresponding files from Google Cloud Storage

3. **Added special handling to calendar_download.py**:
   - Added explicit Microsoft-specific logic in the file download process
   - Ensures all future downloads for Microsoft will use the correct fiscal periods

4. **Added comprehensive tests**:
   - Created `tests/test_msft_fiscal_periods.py` with tests for all fiscal periods
   - Verifies correct fiscal period/year assignment for each Microsoft quarter

## How to Run the Fix

We've created a single script that runs the complete fix:

```bash
python fix_msft_and_download.py
```

This script:
- Deletes all incorrect Microsoft Q4 entries
- Downloads Microsoft filings for the past 2 years with correct fiscal periods

You can specify different date ranges:

```bash
python fix_msft_and_download.py --start-year 2020 --end-year 2025
```

## Verifying the Fix

To verify that the fiscal period logic is correct:

```bash
python -m tests.test_msft_fiscal_periods
```

To verify no Q4 entries remain in the database, run:

```bash
python -c "from fix_msft_fiscal_periods import find_msft_q4_entries; print(f'Found {len(find_msft_q4_entries())} Q4 entries')"
```

## Future Prevention

The fiscal period logic is now correctly implemented in two places:

1. **src/edgar/company_fiscal.py** - Core fiscal calendar logic
2. **calendar_download.py** - Downloading file logic

Both files now consistently enforce that Microsoft's Apr-Jun period should be labeled as "annual" rather than "Q4".
