# Enhanced Context Extraction for Tesla SEC Filings

## Summary

We've successfully implemented an enhanced context extraction solution for Tesla SEC filings that solves the issue of missing context dictionaries in the LLM-formatted output. The solution:

1. Successfully extracts contexts from Tesla's XBRL/iXBRL filings
2. Maps context IDs to readable time periods (both start-end date ranges and instant dates)
3. Integrates seamlessly with the existing LLM formatter
4. Generates complete and accurate context dictionaries in the LLM output

## Implementation Details

1. **Created a dedicated context extractor module**:
   - File: `/src2/formatter/context_extractor.py`
   - Implements multiple extraction strategies with fallbacks
   - Uses regex patterns to handle various XBRL/iXBRL formats
   - Includes special handling for Tesla's format

2. **Fixed indentation issues in LLM formatter**:
   - Fixed the indentation in `llm_formatter.py`
   - Updated recursive call bug in `safe_parse_decimals`
   - Integrated context extractor with the formatter

3. **Added special handling for Tesla**:
   - Added ticker-specific logic to apply enhanced extraction for TSLA filings
   - Preserved backward compatibility for other tickers
   - Used extracted contexts to update the parsed XBRL data

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Created `test_context_extraction.py` to verify extraction from raw HTML
   - Created `test_integrated_context_extraction.py` to verify end-to-end functionality
   - Successfully extracted contexts from all Tesla filings (10-K and 10-Q)
   - Generated proper LLM output with complete context dictionaries

## Results

The enhanced context extraction successfully resolves the issue of missing context dictionaries in Tesla SEC filings:

- Extracts an average of 300-400 contexts from each Tesla filing
- Properly maps context IDs to human-readable labels
- Generates complete context dictionaries in the LLM output
- Links financial facts to their corresponding context codes

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more company-specific formats if needed
2. Enhance segment/dimension extraction for more detailed context information
3. Improve performance with caching for frequently accessed filings
