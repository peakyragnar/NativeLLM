# SEC XBRL Download Improvements

This document describes the improvements to the SEC XBRL download process, which addresses issues with URL construction and reliably handles both domestic and foreign companies.

## Problem

The original SEC filing download implementation suffered from several issues:

1. Inconsistent URL construction that only worked for certain companies
2. Failures with older filings and foreign companies
3. Incorrect company names showing up as "EDGAR | Company Search Results"
4. Missing financial data for many companies

## Solution 

We've implemented a direct approach that properly traverses the SEC website structure:

1. **URL Discovery**: Uses proper document tables to find exact URLs instead of guessing URL patterns
2. **Foreign Company Support**: Automatically detects and handles 20-F filings for foreign companies
3. **Format Detection**: Correctly identifies and handles iXBRL vs HTML documents
4. **Multiple Fallbacks**: Implements layered fallback mechanisms when primary methods fail

## Implementation

### Key Files Updated

1. **src/xbrl/xbrl_downloader.py**: Completely rewritten to use the direct approach
   - `get_filing_urls()`: Better URL discovery
   - `download_xbrl_instance()`: Enhanced XBRL download with metadata extraction
   - `download_html_filing()`: HTML document download with better file naming

2. **src/xbrl/enhanced_processor.py**: Enhanced to support foreign companies
   - Modified `process_company_filing()` to detect and use foreign filing types (20-F) when needed

### New Test File

**test_integration.py**: Comprehensive test script to validate the improvements with multiple companies:
   - Tests URL discovery
   - Tests XBRL and HTML downloading
   - Tests XBRL parsing
   - Tests the entire processing pipeline
   - Supports testing multiple companies in one run

## How to Test

Run the test script with various options:

```bash
# Test the entire pipeline with default companies (MSFT, AAPL, TM)
python test_integration.py --test-all

# Test with a specific company
python test_integration.py --ticker MSFT --test-all

# Test with multiple companies
python test_integration.py --tickers MSFT AAPL TM GOOGL --test-all

# Test only URL discovery
python test_integration.py --ticker TM --test-urls

# Test with a specific filing type
python test_integration.py --ticker AAPL --filing-type 10-Q --test-all
```

## Results

The improved implementation has been tested with:

1. **MSFT** (Microsoft) - Domestic company with 10-K filings
2. **AAPL** (Apple) - Domestic company with various filings
3. **TM** (Toyota) - Foreign company using 20-F filings
4. Other companies including GOOGL, META, AMZN, NVDA

All tests show successful URL discovery, file downloads, and fact extraction.

## Detailed Design

The improved implementation follows these steps:

1. **URL Discovery**:
   - Follows the actual SEC website structure by starting at the company index page
   - Finds the document table for the specific filing
   - Extracts document links from document table pages
   - Properly handles special URLs formats (including iXBRL's `ix?doc=` prefix)

2. **Foreign Company Detection**:
   - When 10-K filing is not found for a company
   - Automatically tries 20-F as a fallback for foreign companies
   - Updates metadata to reflect the actual filing type used

3. **Unified Processing**:
   - Uses a consistent approach for both XBRL and iXBRL formats
   - Implements multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Extracts and preserves filing metadata

## Future Improvements

1. Add full integration with the GCP upload system
2. Add parallel processing for multiple companies
3. Further optimize performance 
4. Add more comprehensive handling for very old filings (pre-2015)
5. Add reporting and analytics on processing success rates

## Conclusion

The improved implementation provides a robust and reliable way to download and process SEC filings, including support for both domestic and foreign companies, different filing types, and various document formats.
